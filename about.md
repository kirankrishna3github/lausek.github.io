My name is Laurin alias lausek or LPK. I am programming things since 2013, mainly on the web and turned my hobby into a "job" (still in apprenticeship) in 2015. Because my company is working with the SAP system, I'm very familiar with plain ABAP.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lausek).
